# Client-Side-Password Vault

A Password vault with encryption solely on client device without any online data storage risk with SHA-512 for password hashing. Meant to work offline but provides optional OTP feature to support extended feature/recovery.

*Uses pure python for GUI which is why it looks so 90s. We may later switch to eel*

# Bugs/Features (Ahem)

  - Single User
  - Can't Reset Password
  - If you hit forgot password, it will delete all data. Try OTP
  - Hideous UI but that doesn't matter says my ghetto hacker network.
  - If it closes abruptly, it isn't supposed to authorise you, try again.

# For Windows 

  - Use the .exe file
  - Sign Up
  - Email is mandatory for OTP, duh.

 # For Linux

  - We know you linux fanboys and gals. So Run ```vault.sh``` the first time.
  - Now your terminal will recognise the command ``` $ vault ```.
  - You can signup and do everything else from terminal
  - Giving you ample features to loathe on that 90s Windows Counterpart,
    just like windows users do for your entire GUI.

 
    
    
# Installation:
If you are in terminal
```
$ ./vault.sh 
````
Windows users can also use it in Git Bash
```
Change /bin/bash in vault.sh to /usr/bin/bash or just type 'which bash' and change accordingly.
```
